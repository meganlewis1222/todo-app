### Description
This project uses React Native to create a To-Do App. It makes use of a modal window to add a task, a text input on the rendered task card that allows the user to tap and edit the task, and a delete button that deletes the task. Two additional Components were used for this project. SecureStore was used in attempt to persist the data of the tasks, but it did not work, so a Context was created and shared which was used. 

Some improvements that may be made to this app include:
- Persisting data
- Animating tasks being added, edited, and deleted for better feedback to user
- Adding shadows to cards and buttons to make them stand out better
